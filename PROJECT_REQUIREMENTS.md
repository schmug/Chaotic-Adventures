# Project Requirements

## âœ¨ Goals
- Generate unpredictable, funny, and engaging gameplay experiences.
- Automatically produce a humorous narrative summary upon game completion.
- Easy deployment via GitLab CI/CD to Cloudflare Pages.

## ðŸš€ Deployment Notes
- Clearly document setup, running locally, and deployment instructions in README.md.
- Ensure pipeline testing via GitLab CI for seamless deployment.

## ðŸ’¡ Future Considerations
- Implement extensibility for community-generated scenarios.
- Optimize for mobile web browsers for wider accessibility.
- Add buffs and debuffs to the LLM, such as wacky temperature numbers, fun system prompts, other languages, etc.
- Allow "upgrading" the LLM to another model. We could really do this, or simulate it.
- Add memory to the runs, where previous are referenced. We could use gravestones or we could introduce the characters who have gone crazy or you've lost control of in previous runs.

Happy coding!
