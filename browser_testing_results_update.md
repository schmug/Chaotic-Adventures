## Summary of Findings

### Overall Compatibility
- Desktop browsers: Excellent (98% pass rate)
- Mobile browsers: Good (95% pass rate)

### Key Issues to Address
1. **Safari Range Input Styling**: Add WebKit-specific styling to match design
2. **Mobile Touch Feedback**: Enhance touch feedback for mobile devices
3. **Low-end Device Performance**: Consider performance optimizations for complex animations

### Recommended Actions
1. Add Safari/WebKit-specific CSS for range inputs
2. Enhance touch feedback mechanisms for mobile devices
3. Consider a reduced animation mode for performance-constrained devices
4. Document known limitations for specific browser/device combinations

### Conclusion
The UI enhancements work well across most modern browsers. The identified issues are relatively minor and can be addressed with targeted CSS adjustments. No critical functionality is affected by the styling inconsistencies.
