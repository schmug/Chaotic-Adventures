# Development Plan for Chaotic Adventures

## 🔍 Phase 1: Testing & Validation ✅
1. Test local LLM and API integrations ✅
   - Verify LLM simulator functions correctly ✅
   - Test compatibility with different local LLM providers (Ollama, llama.cpp) ✅
   - Create comprehensive test cases for edge scenarios ✅

2. Document & align current implementation ✅
   - Ensure documentation matches current implementation ✅
   - Update CLAUDE.md with any implementation changes ✅
   - Verify project structure follows recommended guidelines ✅

## 🏗️ Phase 2: Infrastructure & Reliability ✅
1. Fix deployment issues ✅
   - Address Cloudflare Workers compatibility issues with ES6 template literals ✅
   - Create tools for maintaining _worker.js file (sync_worker.sh, rebuild_worker.js) ✅
   - Document deployment process and common issues in DEPLOYMENT.md ✅

2. Enhance error handling and reliability ✅
   - Implement emergency initialization scripts for failsafe operation ✅
   - Add debug tools for identifying and resolving issues ✅
   - Create graceful fallbacks to ensure minimum viable functionality ✅
   - Develop screen transition fixes to ensure proper UI state ✅

3. Testing and verification ✅
   - Verify all LLM modes function correctly ✅
   - Test emergency tools and fallbacks ✅
   - Ensure screen transitions are reliable ✅
