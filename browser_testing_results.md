# Browser Testing Results

## Test Environment
- **Browser:** Chrome Version 123.0.6312.59 (Latest)
- **OS:** macOS
- **Date:** 2025-03-22
- **Tester:** Claude

## Summary
Performed initial verification of screen transitions in Chaotic Adventures v1.3.1. Testing focused on basic start screen functionality and transition to game screen using different LLM modes.

## Test Results

### 1. Screen Transition Testing

#### Basic Transitions
- ✅ Start screen loads correctly with proper styling
- ✅ Begin Adventure button is visible and properly styled
- ✅ Player can enter name and select chaos level
- ✅ LLM mode selection functions correctly
- ⚠️ Game screen transition issue identified with browser LLM mode (stays on start screen)

### 2. LLM Mode Testing

#### Mode Selection
- ✅ Mock response mode is selected by default
- ✅ Browser LLM mode can be selected
- ✅ Server mode correctly shows as unavailable

## Identified Issues
1. **Browser LLM Screen Transition:** When selecting "Run LLM in Browser" mode, clicking Begin Adventure doesn't transition to the game screen as expected. This might be related to the loading mechanism for the browser LLM or a specific issue with the showScreen() function when handling browser LLM initialization. **[FIXED - See browser_testing_results_update.md]**

## Next Steps
1. Test with mock mode in other browsers to validate basic screen transitions
2. Investigate browser LLM loading mechanism in app.js
3. Check if there are any console errors during the browser LLM initialization
4. Complete the remaining test scenarios in the test protocol
